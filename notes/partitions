Reference
/dev/sda: SSD
/dev/sdb: HDD

Instructions:
Start in legacy BIOS (do not use UEFI)
Run GParted during ISO boot
Create /dev/sda1 as ext2 with label "boot"
Create /dev/sda2 as an Extended Partition
Create /dev/sda5 as unformatted
Apply
Create /dev/sdb1 as an Extended Partition
Create /dev/sdb5 as unformatted
Apply

Start setting up LVM:
pvcreate /dev/sda5 # Physical volume on sda
pvcreate /dev/sdb5 # Physical volume on sdb
vgcreate lmsdd /dev/sda5 #
vgcreate lmhdd /dev/sdb5
lvcreate -L 16G -n root lmsdd
lvcreate -L 32G -n home lmsdd
lvcreate -L 8G -n swap lmhdd
lvcreate -L 16G -n tmp lmhdd
lvcreate -L 16G -n var lmhdd

You may need to unselect the swap partition and re-add it in /etc/fstab after installation, the installer might otherwise fail to use the swap partition correctly
    sudo blkid /dev/mapper/lmhdd-swap  # obtain the UUID of swap partition
    sudo vim /etc/fstab  # Uncomment the swapfile and add the UUID of the swap partition in its place
Bootloader should be /dev/sda (NOT /dev/sda1, we are not using UEFI)
/dev/sda1 should be mounted as /boot
/dev/mapper/lmsdd-tmp should be mounted as /tmp, etc.
/dev/mapper/lmsdd-home can be unmounted (installer might hang at "removing conflicting operating system files"), mount it in /etc/fstab after installation
/dev/mapper/lmhdd-home should be mounted after installation

Start installing Linux Mint:
DON'T SELECT DEFAULT OPTIONS! Follow the partition setup as described above.

Run linux-setup from Git repo

The following was done after install:
lvcreate -L 100G -n home lmhdd
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/lmhdd/home

Edit /etc/fstab and add the following:
/dev/mapper/lmhdd-home /hdd            ext4    defaults        0       2

Add symbolic links to hdd:
ln -s ~/hdd /hdd
